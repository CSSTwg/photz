we note that Eazy has been shown to produce redshift estimates with the lowest scatter and the smallest fraction of outliers of any of the public photometric redshift codes (Hildebrandt et al. 2010).

Hildebrandt, H., Arnouts, S., Capak, P., et al. 2010, A&A, 523, 31


We derive a new minimal template set based purely on stellar population synthesis models

The template set is calculated following the novel “NMF” algorithm of BR07

which essentially takes a large number, Nin , of synthetic models and computes a reduced set of Nout basis templates that best reproduce a supplied broadband photometric calibration catalog. 

N_in: synthetic model
N_out: basis templates

Hi Luis, after discussion among ourselves, below is our tentative plan for photz. Our primary goal is to test how different code configurations, templates, and input filter combinations will affect photoz accuracies. Please check it. 

Using galaxy sample of different imaging data to test the fitting performance of various photz-fitting codes (eazy, Lephare, Bagpipes, Cigale).


1. Wen and Bingcheng: run relevant codes with different templates for JWST-only SEDs, and compare with the Specz.


2. Chao: run Eazy and other codes with different templates for HST-only SEDs.........

3. Changhao: run relevant codes with different templates and filter combinations for JWST-observed high-z AGNs......

4. Limin: run Eazy and other codes with different input SFHs for SEDs derived from multiple facilities....... 






####################################

0: Wen+Bingcheng run all codes with various available templates using Stefanon2017's SED.

   Chao runs all codes with various available templates using Stefanon2017's SED.
   
   Changhao runs Eazy with various available templates using Stefanon2017's SED.

   Ruancun runs Eazy with various available templates using Stefanon2017's SED.

   And then evaluate template performances within each code (using Spec-z as reference)
  
   Compare above results with Limin and Stefanon2017.

(I do this using Stefanon2017's SED and eazy with different template, find the result is quite consistent, and make a demo to others, so that others can directly run) 


1. Wen+Bingcheng: Replace the photometries of relevant filters in Stefanon2017'SED with new JWST photometry, then run all codes with various available templates, and then compare with Stefanon2017's result to see the improvement.

2. Wen+Bingcheng: run all codes with various available templates using JWST/CEERS-only SEDs, and then compare the fitting performance for objects with specz.

3. Changhao: runs Eazy with different templates and filter combinations for JWST-observed high-z AGNs......


4. Chao: runs all codes with various available templates using HST/HFF-only SEDs, and then compare the fitting peformances.......


5. CSST-only bands and CSST+Roman-only bands :

(Note: the adopted codes and templates in Step1,2,3,4 may change based on the conclusions in Step0.)


This is the agenda for the next meeting.

1. Chao and limin individually run eazy with various available templates using Stefanon2017's SED, then compare each other, and also compare with Stefanon2017's photoz, to evaluate the fitting performance.

2. Limin run eazy with various available templates using her own input SED.


The meeting time is on next Friday 2:00pm.
